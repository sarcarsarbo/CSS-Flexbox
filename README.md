## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project allowed me to understand and implement CSS flexboxes to replicate a clean and minimalist design for a static page.

### Continued development

Further features can be added to the static site.

### Useful resources

- [Aligning items in a flex container](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Aligning_items_in_a_flex_container) - This helped me to understand the layout better and align the items properly.
- [CSS Box Shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me to implement box shadows in CSS, a feature that subtly leveraged the design.
